# image_classification_using_convolutional_neural_networks
This is a simple machine learning project for image classification using convolutional neutral networks. This project is easy going and classifies two datasets, cifar-100 and caltech-101. It has been written in python using tensorflow. To run, just download the project and dataset (I have uploaded both here) and run it in python. To change the network and data structure, just edit the variables in __init__ function of the config.py file. I tried to write this project in a form that you do not need to go deep in the code, just click run to start the project.
